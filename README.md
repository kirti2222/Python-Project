# Project Title: Bank Loan Analysis
## Project Objective
To conduct a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data to understand key metrics, identify trends and evaluate risk factors for a bank that provides loan services to its customers.
## Dataset Used:
https://github.com/kirti2222/Python-Project/blob/main/financial_loan.xlsx
## Project Questions
1. What are the total loan amounts issued and the total payments collected from borrowers?
2.  What is the breakdown and distribution of loans by their current status?
3.  Does the term of the loan (36 months vs. 60 months) significantly impact the total amount paid or the loan performance/risk?
4. How are loan applications distributed across different borrower home ownership categories?
5. Are there significant differences in loan amount, interest rate, or loan status across the various states (address_state) where borrowers reside?
## Project Process
1. Data Acquisition and Setup
This is the initial phase, evidenced by the library imports and data loading steps.

Import Libraries: Load necessary Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and plotly.express) for data manipulation, visualization, and warnings.

Load Data: Read the raw bank loan dataset (likely from a CSV or similar file) into a pandas DataFrame.

Initial Inspection: Perform basic checks on the loaded data (e.g., df.head(), df.info(), df.describe()) to understand its structure, data types, and initial value distribution.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The analysis mentions checking column counts, which implies data quality checks are a priority.

Handle Missing Values: Identify columns with missing data (NaNs) and decide on an imputation strategy (e.g., dropping columns with too many missing values, filling numerical gaps with the mean/median, or categorical gaps with the mode).

Feature Transformation: Convert data types where necessary (e.g., ensuring numerical columns like loan_amount are proper numbers). Clean text fields like term and emp_length (e.g., removing extra characters or converting them to numerical representations).

Outlier Treatment: Identify and decide how to handle extreme values (outliers) in key financial columns like annual_income or dti.

Data Validation: Ensure data consistency across the dataset.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This is the core analysis stage, where the project questions are addressed using visualizations and statistics.

Univariate Analysis: Analyze individual features:

Plot the distribution of key numerical columns (loan_amount, int_rate, annual_income).

Determine the frequency of categorical variables (loan_status, grade, home_ownership).

Bivariate Analysis (Financial Metrics): Calculate and visualize aggregate metrics:

Total Loan Amount and Total Payments.

Distribution of loan_status by term.

Multivariate Analysis (Risk and Segmentation): Examine relationships between multiple variables:

Create visualizations (like the mentioned Treemap) to analyze loan applications by borrower segment (e.g., home_ownership and address_state).

Analyze the default rate (loan_status = Charged Off) against different risk factors (grade, dti, annual_income).

4. Reporting and Conclusion
This final phase summarizes the findings to meet the project objective.

Synthesize Findings: Consolidate the results from the EDA to provide clear answers to the project questions.

Develop Visualizations: Finalize the most insightful charts and graphs for the report.

Draw Conclusions: State the key takeaways, such as the highest-risk borrower segments or the most profitable loan types.
## Project Insights


Provide Recommendations: Offer data-driven suggestions for the bank on improving loan approval processes or mitigating risk.
